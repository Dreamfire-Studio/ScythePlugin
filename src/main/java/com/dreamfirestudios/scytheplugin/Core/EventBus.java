/**
 * A minimal, thread-aware event and task dispatcher for Bukkit plugins.
 *
 * <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Fire Bukkit {@link Event}s on the <strong>main server thread</strong>.</li>
 *   <li>Run user-supplied tasks on the main thread either immediately or after a delay.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Threading</h2>
 * <p>
 * Event dispatch always occurs on the main thread. If the caller is already on the main thread,
 * dispatch is synchronous; otherwise the call is marshalled using {@link Scheduler#main(Runnable)}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Nullability & Contracts</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>The constructor requires a non-null {@link Plugin}.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #fire(Event)} requires a non-null {@link Event} instance.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #runMain(Runnable)} and {@link #runLater(Runnable, long)} require a non-null task.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Examples</h2>
 * <pre>{@code
 * EventBus bus = new EventBus(plugin);
 * bus.fire(new MyCustomEvent(...)); // safe from any thread
 * bus.runMain(() -> logger.info("Hello from main thread"));
 * bus.runLater(() -> doTick(), 20L); // ~1s later
 * }</pre>
